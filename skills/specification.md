# Overview

> A simple, open format for giving agents new capabilities and expertise.

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to do things more accurately and efficiently.

# What are skills?

> Agent Skills are a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows.

At its core, a skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file. This file includes metadata (`name` and `description`, at minimum) and instructions that tell an agent how to perform a specific task. Skills can also bundle scripts, templates, and reference materials.

```directory  theme={null}
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
```

## How skills work

Skills use **progressive disclosure** to manage context efficiently:

1. **Discovery**: At startup, agents load only the name and description of each available skill, just enough to know when it might be relevant.

2. **Activation**: When a task matches a skill's description, the agent reads the full `SKILL.md` instructions into context.

3. **Execution**: The agent follows the instructions, optionally loading referenced files or executing bundled code as needed.

This approach keeps agents fast while giving them access to more context on demand.

## The SKILL.md file

Every skill starts with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and Markdown instructions:

```mdx  theme={null}
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents.
---

# PDF Processing

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when the user needs to work with PDF files...

## How to extract text
1. Use pdfplumber for text extraction...

## How to fill forms
...
```

The following frontmatter is required at the top of `SKILL.md`:

* `name`: A short identifier
* `description`: When to use this skill

The Markdown body contains the actual instructions and has no specific restrictions on structure or content.

This simple format has some key advantages:

* **Self-documenting**: A skill author or user can read a `SKILL.md` and understand what it does, making skills easy to audit and improve.

* **Extensible**: Skills can range in complexity from just text instructions to executable code, assets, and templates.

* **Portable**: Skills are just files, so they're easy to edit, version, and share.

# Specification

> The complete format specification for Agent Skills.

This document defines the Agent Skills format.

## Directory structure

A skill is a directory containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md          # Required
```

<Tip>
  You can optionally include [additional directories](#optional-directories) such as `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to support your skill.
</Tip>

## SKILL.md format

The `SKILL.md` file must contain YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content.

### Frontmatter (required)

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: skill-name
description: A description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---
```

With optional fields:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents.
license: Apache-2.0
metadata:
  author: example-org
  version: "1.0"
---
```

| Field           | Required | Constraints                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`          | Yes      | Max 64 characters. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Must not start or end with a hyphen.             |
| `description`   | Yes      | Max 1024 characters. Non-empty. Describes what the skill does and when to use it.                                 |
| `license`       | No       | License name or reference to a bundled license file.                                                              |
| `compatibility` | No       | Max 500 characters. Indicates environment requirements (intended product, system packages, network access, etc.). |
| `metadata`      | No       | Arbitrary key-value mapping for additional metadata.                                                              |
| `allowed-tools` | No       | Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools the skill may use. (Experimental)                                      |

#### `name` field

The required `name` field:

* Must be 1-64 characters
* May only contain unicode lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`a-z` and `-`)
* Must not start or end with `-`
* Must not contain consecutive hyphens (`--`)
* Must match the parent directory name

Valid examples:

```yaml  theme={null}
name: pdf-processing
```

```yaml  theme={null}
name: data-analysis
```

```yaml  theme={null}
name: code-review
```

Invalid examples:

```yaml  theme={null}
name: PDF-Processing  # uppercase not allowed
```

```yaml  theme={null}
name: -pdf  # cannot start with hyphen
```

```yaml  theme={null}
name: pdf--processing  # consecutive hyphens not allowed
```

#### `description` field

The required `description` field:

* Must be 1-1024 characters
* Should describe both what the skill does and when to use it
* Should include specific keywords that help agents identify relevant tasks

Good example:

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

Poor example:

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Helps with PDFs.
```

#### `license` field

The optional `license` field:

* Specifies the license applied to the skill
* We recommend keeping it short (either the name of a license or the name of a bundled license file)

Example:

```yaml  theme={null}
license: Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms
```

#### `compatibility` field

The optional `compatibility` field:

* Must be 1-500 characters if provided
* Should only be included if your skill has specific environment requirements
* Can indicate intended product, required system packages, network access needs, etc.

Examples:

```yaml  theme={null}
compatibility: Designed for Claude Code (or similar products)
```

```yaml  theme={null}
compatibility: Requires git, docker, jq, and access to the internet
```

<Note>
  Most skills do not need the `compatibility` field.
</Note>

#### `metadata` field

The optional `metadata` field:

* A map from string keys to string values
* Clients can use this to store additional properties not defined by the Agent Skills spec
* We recommend making your key names reasonably unique to avoid accidental conflicts

Example:

```yaml  theme={null}
metadata:
  author: example-org
  version: "1.0"
```

#### `allowed-tools` field

The optional `allowed-tools` field:

* A space-delimited list of tools that are pre-approved to run
* Experimental. Support for this field may vary between agent implementations

Example:

```yaml  theme={null}
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*) Bash(jq:*) Read
```

### Body content

The Markdown body after the frontmatter contains the skill instructions. There are no format restrictions. Write whatever helps agents perform the task effectively.

Recommended sections:

* Step-by-step instructions
* Examples of inputs and outputs
* Common edge cases

Note that the agent will load this entire file once it's decided to activate a skill. Consider splitting longer `SKILL.md` content into referenced files.

## Optional directories

### scripts/

Contains executable code that agents can run. Scripts should:

* Be self-contained or clearly document dependencies
* Include helpful error messages
* Handle edge cases gracefully

Supported languages depend on the agent implementation. Common options include Python, Bash, and JavaScript.

### references/

Contains additional documentation that agents can read when needed:

* `REFERENCE.md` - Detailed technical reference
* `FORMS.md` - Form templates or structured data formats
* Domain-specific files (`finance.md`, `legal.md`, etc.)

Keep individual [reference files](#file-references) focused. Agents load these on demand, so smaller files mean less use of context.

### assets/

Contains static resources:

* Templates (document templates, configuration templates)
* Images (diagrams, examples)
* Data files (lookup tables, schemas)

## Progressive disclosure

Skills should be structured for efficient use of context:

1. **Metadata** (\~100 tokens): The `name` and `description` fields are loaded at startup for all skills
2. **Instructions** (\< 5000 tokens recommended): The full `SKILL.md` body is loaded when the skill is activated
3. **Resources** (as needed): Files (e.g. those in `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`) are loaded only when required

Keep your main `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.

## File references

When referencing other files in your skill, use relative paths from the skill root:

```markdown  theme={null}
See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.

Run the extraction script:
scripts/extract.py
```

Keep file references one level deep from `SKILL.md`. Avoid deeply nested reference chains.

## Validation

Use the [skills-ref](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref) reference library to validate your skills:

```bash  theme={null}
skills-ref validate ./my-skill
```

This checks that your `SKILL.md` frontmatter is valid and follows all naming conventions.
